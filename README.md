# Machine Learning Projects

Repository of different machine learning projects

## Clickbait Prediction in Youtube
Problem: Clickbait is common in Youtube.

Solution: Using video titles and video statistics, the videos in youtube is classified if it is a clickbait or not using different machine learning models.

*Remarks: This project is done with Python.*

**Solution 1: Machine learning models employed for Classification:**

1.) Naive Bayes

2.) Logistic Regression

3.) Support Vector Machines

4.) Multilayer Perceptron

*Remarks: Due to lack of data, the models yield subpar performance in testing.*

**Solution 2:Machine learning models employed for Regression:**

1.) Support Vector Machine

2.) Multilayer Perceptron

*Remarks: Due to lack of data, the models yield subpar performance in testing.*

Future Work: 

1.) Increase quantity and quality of data.

2.) Improve further the model, implement with different python packages

3.) Extension: Use of thumbnails for future work.

## Removal of Projective Distortion in Images
Problem: Distorted and mis-aligned pictures

Solution: Using base concepts of image processing and python, the images is transformed for better view.

*Remarks: This project is done in Python.*

**Solution 1: Core Concepts and Numpy**

Using numpy, Projective Distortion Removal is done.

*Remarks: Not finished*

**Solution 2: OpenCV**

Using OpenCV module in Python, Projective Distortion Removal is done.

## Music Genre Classification
Problem: With the continuous growth in music generated, detecting the genre of music can greatly aid for data annotation.

Solution: Using audio signal processing and python, the music genre of data is classified.

*Remarks: Initially the project is done in MATLAB, still translating to Python*

**Audio Signal Processing: Music Genre**
