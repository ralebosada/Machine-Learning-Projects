# Machine Learning Projects

Repository of different machine learning projects

## Clickbait Prediction in Youtube
Problem: Clickbait is common in Youtube.
Solution: Using video titles and video statistics, the videos in youtube is classified if it is a clickbait or not using different machine learning models.
This project is done with Python.

**Machine learning models employed for Classification:**

1.) Naive Bayes

2.) Logistic Regression

3.) Support Vector Machines

4.) Multilayer Perceptron

*Remarks: Due to lack of data, the models yield subpar performance in testing.*

**Machine learning models employed for Regression:**

1.) Support Vector Machine

2.) Multilayer Perceptron

*Remarks: Due to lack of data, the models yield subpar performance in testing.*

Future Work: 
1.) Increase quantity and quality of data.

2.) Improve further the model, implement with different python packages

3.) Extension: Use of thumbnails for future work.

## Removal of Projective Distortion in Images
Problem: Distorted and mis-aligned pictures
Solution: Using base concepts of image processing and python, the images is transformed for better view.
This project is done in Python.

**Solution 1: Core Concepts and Numpy**

Using numpy, Projective Distortion Removal is done.
*Remarks: Not finished*

**Solution 2: OpenCV**

Using OpenCV module in Python, Projective Distortion Removal is done.
